# learningr
My versions of projects and exercises from "R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund

My intentions are to:
1. Learn R skills necessary for data science
2. Familiarize myself with Github as a tool for collaboration and organization

I'm using the second release of the first edition of the book. My thanks to the authors and publisher, O'Reilly, for the structure.
